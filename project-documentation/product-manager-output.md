# Template Library Integration - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

### Elevator Pitch
Transform ROCQET's standalone Template Library into a seamless, integrated marketplace where users can discover, publish, and import professional AI prompt templates directly within their workspace workflow.

### Problem Statement
Currently, the Template Library exists as a disconnected component at `/templates` without proper workspace integration. Users cannot publish their personal prompts to the community, import templates into specific workspaces, or access the library through the main navigation. This creates a fragmented user experience that undermines the "GitHub for AI Prompts" vision.

### Target Audience
- **Primary**: Pro and Team tier users who create and share prompts professionally
- **Secondary**: Free tier users discovering and importing community templates
- **Tertiary**: Organizations building internal template libraries

### Unique Selling Proposition
First workspace-aware prompt template marketplace with enterprise-grade permissions, seamless personal-to-public publishing, and integrated workspace import workflow.

### Success Metrics
- Template publishing rate: 15% of Pro users publish monthly
- Template discovery rate: 60% of users import templates quarterly
- Template engagement: Average 3.5 templates imported per user per month
- User retention: +25% increase in monthly active users

## Feature Specifications

### 1. Integrated Navigation Structure

**Feature**: Template Library Navigation Integration
**User Story**: As a workspace user, I want to access the Template Library through my workspace navigation, so that I can seamlessly discover and manage templates alongside my personal prompts.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I'm in any workspace, when I view the sidebar, then I see "Browse Templates" under a new "Templates" section
- Given I click "Browse Templates", when the page loads, then I see the template library with full workspace context
- Given I'm viewing templates, when I use the breadcrumb navigation, then I can return to my workspace seamlessly
- Edge case: Template library maintains consistent header/sidebar layout with workspace theme

**Priority**: P0 (Foundational requirement)
**Dependencies**: Current sidebar structure, workspace routing
**Technical Constraints**: Must work with existing `[workspace]` routing pattern
**UX Considerations**: Templates section positioned between "Prompts" and "Settings" in sidebar

### 2. Personal to Public Publishing Workflow

**Feature**: Publish Prompt to Template Library
**User Story**: As a Pro user with valuable prompts, I want to publish my personal prompts to the Template Library, so that I can share my expertise and build my reputation.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I'm viewing a personal prompt, when I click "Publish to Templates", then I see a publishing modal with template metadata fields
- Given I complete the publishing form, when I submit, then my prompt is added to the Template Library with proper attribution
- Given I publish a template, when other users view it, then they see my name, avatar, and workspace attribution
- Edge case: Publishing maintains version history and allows updates to published templates

**Priority**: P0 (Core feature)
**Dependencies**: Existing prompt structure, user authentication
**Technical Constraints**: Must preserve original prompt while creating template copy
**UX Considerations**: Clear visual distinction between personal prompts and published templates

### 3. Template Discovery and Import System

**Feature**: Workspace-Aware Template Import
**User Story**: As any workspace member, I want to discover relevant templates and import them into my workspace, so that I can leverage community expertise for my projects.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I'm browsing templates, when I click "Import to Workspace", then I see a modal to select destination workspace and customize the template
- Given I import a template, when the import completes, then the template appears in my workspace prompts with "Imported from Templates" attribution
- Given I import a template, when I modify it, then my changes remain separate from the original template
- Edge case: Import process handles variable mapping and workspace-specific customization

**Priority**: P0 (Core feature)
**Dependencies**: Template schema, workspace permissions, prompt creation flow
**Technical Constraints**: Must handle workspace-specific variable defaults and settings
**UX Considerations**: Import flow should be quick (< 3 clicks) with preview capability

### 4. Template Statistics and Engagement

**Feature**: Template Performance Metrics
**User Story**: As a template author, I want to see how my templates perform, so that I can understand their impact and improve future templates.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I published templates, when I view my author profile, then I see views, imports, likes, and ratings for each template
- Given users interact with my templates, when I check my notifications, then I see engagement updates (likes, comments, high usage)
- Given I'm viewing any template, when I see the stats, then they're updated in real-time
- Edge case: Statistics are workspace-scoped for privacy while maintaining public engagement metrics

**Priority**: P1 (Important for engagement)
**Dependencies**: Notification system, analytics infrastructure
**Technical Constraints**: Real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions
**UX Considerations**: Stats displayed prominently but not overwhelming the content

### 5. Permission-Based Template Management

**Feature**: Template Access Control
**User Story**: As a workspace admin, I want to control template publishing permissions, so that I can maintain quality standards and organizational policies.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I'm a workspace admin, when I configure settings, then I can set template publishing permissions (anyone, pro users, admins only)
- Given I have publishing permissions, when I create templates, then they're subject to workspace-defined approval workflows
- Given I'm a team member, when I import templates, then imports respect workspace limits and restrictions
- Edge case: Personal workspaces have different permission rules than team workspaces

**Priority**: P1 (Important for enterprise)
**Dependencies**: Workspace permissions system, subscription tiers
**Technical Constraints**: Must integrate with existing RLS policies
**UX Considerations**: Clear permission indicators without cluttering the interface

   - No: Show upgrade prompt or permission request
   - Yes: Continue to step 3
3. Publishing modal opens with metadata fields
4. User fills: title, description, category, tags, use case, example I/O
5. User sets visibility (public/unlisted) and pricing (future)
6. System validates → Check: Is template content appropriate?
   - No: Show content guidelines and request revision
   - Yes: Continue to step 7
7. Template published with attribution
8. Original prompt remains unchanged in workspace

**Template Discovery Flow**:
1. User navigates to Templates section
2. System displays curated templates with filtering
3. User searches/filters by category, tags, or use case
4. User clicks template → Shows detailed view with examples
5. User clicks "Import to Workspace" → Check: Does user have import permissions?
   - No: Show workspace limits or upgrade prompt
   - Yes: Continue to step 6
6. Import modal with workspace selection and customization
7. User customizes variables, settings, folder destination
8. Template imported as new prompt in selected workspace

#### State Management Needs
