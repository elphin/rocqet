# ðŸŽ¯ ROCQET MISSION - Why We're Building This

## The Problem We're Solving

### The Current Reality
Teams using AI face a **prompt management crisis**:
- **Prompts scattered** across Slack, Notion, Google Docs, email
- **No version control** - "Which version worked better?"
- **No collaboration** - Everyone reinventing the wheel
- **No optimization** - Using suboptimal prompts costs $$$
- **No compliance** - Who used what? When? Why?

### The Hidden Cost
```yaml
Average Enterprise:
  - 50 employees using AI
  - 20 prompts per person per week
  - 30% suboptimal prompts
  - Result: $50K+ wasted annually on inefficient AI usage
```
