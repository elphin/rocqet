# üöÄ ROCQET - Enterprise AI Prompt Management Platform

> **The GitHub for AI Prompts** - Built for teams that take AI seriously.

## üìå Start Here

This folder contains EVERYTHING needed to build ROCQET from scratch as a **high-end enterprise SaaS** product. No compromises, no shortcuts.

### Quick Navigation
1. **[MISSION.md](./MISSION.md)** - Why we're building this (read first!)
2. **[MASTER_PLAN.md](./MASTER_PLAN.md)** - Complete technical architecture
3. **[FEATURES_SPECIFICATION.md](./FEATURES_SPECIFICATION.md)** - Every feature in detail
4. **[AI_SYSTEM/](./AI_SYSTEM/)** - How to work efficiently with AI
5. **[INITIAL_SETUP/](./INITIAL_SETUP/)** - Automated setup scripts

## üéØ What is ROCQET?

**ROCQET** is an enterprise-grade prompt management platform that solves the chaos of AI prompt management for teams. Think of it as:
- **Version Control** for prompts (Git-style branching & merging)
- **Real-time Collaboration** (Google Docs for prompts)
- **Enterprise Security** (SSO, audit trails, compliance)
- **AI Optimization** (automatic improvements, cost tracking)

## üí∞ Business Model

```yaml
Tiers:
  Starter:    Free        - 1 user, 100 prompts
  Pro:        $20/user/mo - Unlimited, AI features
  Team:       $15/user/mo - Collaboration, audit trail  
  Enterprise: Custom      - SSO, SLA, dedicated support
```

## üèóÔ∏è Tech Stack (No Compromises)

```typescript
// Optimized for Vercel + Supabase deployment
{
  "framework": "Next.js 14",        // Stable, production-ready
  "database": "Supabase Postgres",  // With vector embeddings
  "orm": "Drizzle",                 // Edge-ready, fast
  "search": "Typesense Cloud",      // Millisecond search
  "realtime": "Supabase Realtime",  // Collaboration
  "ai": "OpenAI + Anthropic",       // Multi-provider
  "monitoring": "Sentry + Vercel",  // Complete observability
}
```

## üöÄ Development Workflow

### For AI Developers
```bash
# 1. Read current context
cat ROCQET/AI_SYSTEM/DAILY_CONTEXT.md

# 2. Check available agents
cat ROCQET/AI_SYSTEM/AGENTS_USAGE.md

# 3. Start building
npm run dev
```

### For Human Developers
```bash
# 1. Run automated setup
bash ROCQET/INITIAL_SETUP/setup.sh

# 2. Follow the workflow
open ROCQET/WORKFLOWS/FEATURE_WORKFLOW.md

# 3. Start building
npm run dev
```

## üìÇ Folder Structure Explained

| Folder | Purpose | When to Use |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **AI_SYSTEM/** | AI development optimization | Every AI session |
| **INITIAL_SETUP/** | Project bootstrapping | Once at start |
| **ARCHITECTURE/** | Technical decisions | When building features |
| **WORKFLOWS/** | Development processes | During development |
| **REUSABLE_CODE/** | Working code to copy | When implementing |
| **KNOWLEDGE/** | Lessons & best practices | To avoid mistakes |

## ‚ú® Key Differentiators

### 1. Git-Style Prompt Versioning
```typescript
// No other tool has this!
await createBranch(promptId, 'experiment/new-approach')
await mergeBranch(experimentId, 'main', 'Improved by 20%')
```

### 2. Real-Time Collaboration
```typescript
// Multiple users editing simultaneously
<CollaborativeEditor presence={true} locking="optimistic" />
```

### 3. AI-Powered Search
```typescript
// Semantic search with embeddings
const similar = await searchByMeaning("customer support email")
```

### 4. Enterprise Audit Trail
```typescript
// Complete history of everything
const audit = await getAuditLog({ 
  compliance: 'SOC2',
  format: 'json' 
})
```

## ‚ö° Quick Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev           # Start development (port 3000)
npm run build         # Production build
npm run test          # Run tests

# Database
npm run db:push       # Push schema changes
npm run db:migrate    # Run migrations
npm run db:studio     # Visual database browser

```

## üö¶ Getting Started

### Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)
```bash
bash ROCQET/INITIAL_SETUP/setup.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup
1. Read [INITIAL_SETUP/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md](./INITIAL_SETUP/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md)
2. Install dependencies from [INITIAL_SETUP/DEPENDENCIES.json](./INITIAL_SETUP/DEPENDENCIES.json)
3. Configure environment from [INITIAL_SETUP/ENV_TEMPLATE.md](./INITIAL_SETUP/ENV_TEMPLATE.md)

## ü§ù For AI Assistants

**IMPORTANT**: This is an enterprise SaaS product. Always:
- Think **workspace-first**, not user-first
- Implement **real-time** features from the start
- Include **audit trails** for everything
- Design for **100,000+ users** scale
- Never compromise on **security**
