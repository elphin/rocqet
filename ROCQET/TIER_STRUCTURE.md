## üéØ Key Concepts

### Personal vs Team Workspaces

#### **Personal Workspaces (Starter/Pro)**
- One workspace per subscription
- Cannot invite team members
- Owner pays for their own subscription
- Workspace type: `personal`
- Can be upgraded from Starter ‚Üí Pro (keeps same workspace)

#### **Team Workspaces (Team Tier)**
- Multiple workspaces possible
- Seat pool shared across all team workspaces
- Owner manages seat distribution
- Workspace type: `team`
- Owner pays for all seats

---

## üí∫ Seat Pool Management (Team Tier)

### How It Works:
1. **Team owner purchases seat pool** (min 2 seats)
2. **Creates multiple team workspaces** as needed
3. **Distributes seats across workspaces**
4. **Total members across all workspaces ‚â§ total seats purchased**

### Example:
```
Company ABC purchases 10 seats:
- Marketing Team Workspace: 4 members
- Development Team Workspace: 3 members  
- Design Team Workspace: 3 members
Total: 10 members = 10 seats ‚úì
```

### Seat Rules:
- ‚úÖ Can create unlimited workspaces (within seat limit)
- ‚úÖ Can move members between workspaces
- ‚úÖ Can buy additional seats anytime (per seat, not in blocks)
- ‚ùå Cannot exceed total purchased seats
- ‚ùå Cannot have less than 2 seats (minimum)
- ‚ùå Must remove members before reducing seats

## üîÑ Upgrade/Downgrade Flows

### Upgrade Paths:
```
Starter ‚Üí Pro: 
  - Same workspace upgraded
  - Type remains 'personal'
  - Instant feature unlock

Starter/Pro ‚Üí Team:
  - Creates NEW team workspace
  - Keeps personal workspace
  - Becomes owner of team workspace
  
Team ‚Üí More Seats:
  - Instant addition
  - Can allocate to any workspace
```

### Downgrade Paths:
```
Pro ‚Üí Starter:
  - Keep workspace, lose features
  - Prompts over 25 become read-only
  - API access revoked
  
Team ‚Üí Fewer Seats:
  - Must remove members first
  - Cannot go below 2 seats
  - Workspaces remain but may be understaffed
  
Team ‚Üí Pro/Starter:
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Complex: Need to decide what happens to team workspaces
  - Option 1: Archive team workspaces (read-only)
  - Option 2: Transfer ownership to another member
  - Option 3: Delete team workspaces (with warning)
```

## üí∞ Billing Logic

### Personal Workspaces:
- User pays directly
- Single subscription
- Monthly/yearly billing

### Team Workspaces:
- Owner pays for all seats
- Single bill for entire seat pool
- Can have multiple team workspaces on one subscription
- Seat changes are prorated

### Multiple Workspace Scenario:
```
User Jane has:
- Personal Workspace (Pro) - Jane pays ‚Ç¨19/month
- ACME Team (member) - ACME owner pays
- StartupX Team (owner) - Jane pays for 5 seats ‚Ç¨139/month

Total Jane pays: ‚Ç¨19 + ‚Ç¨139 = ‚Ç¨158/month
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

### Downgrade Protection:
- **Data Loss Prevention**: Never delete data on downgrade
- **Grace Period**: 30 days to export data before restrictions
- **Feature Degradation**: Gracefully disable features, don't break
- **Clear Communication**: Warn before any destructive action

### Seat Management Edge Cases:
1. **Owner leaves team**: Must transfer ownership first
2. **Seat reduction**: Block if members > new seat count
3. **Workspace deletion**: Free up seats for reallocation
4. **Member in multiple workspaces**: Counts as 1 seat in pool

### Database Fields:
```sql
workspaces:
  - workspace_type: 'personal' | 'team' | 'organization'
  - is_personal: boolean
  - subscription_tier: 'starter' | 'pro' | 'team'
  - parent_account_id: UUID (for team workspaces, points to owner's account)
  
accounts: (new table needed)
  - id: UUID
  - owner_id: UUID (user who owns the account)
  - subscription_tier: 'starter' | 'pro' | 'team'
  - total_seats: integer (for team tier)
  - used_seats: integer (calculated)
```

## üöÄ Implementation Priority

1. **Phase 1**: Update tier names everywhere
2. **Phase 2**: Implement account/seat pool structure
3. **Phase 3**: Build upgrade/downgrade flows
4. **Phase 4**: Add seat management UI
5. **Phase 5**: Handle edge cases & restrictions

## üìù Notes for Development

- Always use new names: `starter`, `pro`, `team` (not free/business)
- Team tier creates `team` type workspaces
- Personal tiers use `personal` type workspaces
- Seat pool is account-level, not workspace-level
- Minimum viable team = 2 seats (owner + 1 member)
